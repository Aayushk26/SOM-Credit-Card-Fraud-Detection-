Predicting Fraud amongst credit card users
A basic understanding
-Note: Selecction of outliers will chnage the outcome.Clustering will follow a different pattern if number of outliers selected are varied.
- The model also depends on the threshhold of MID value the user ( in this case the bank ) sets as fraudulent.
Any suggestions to improve the model will be appreciated. It will be really helpful.
